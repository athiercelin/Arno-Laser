# Arno Laser
Arno Laser is a DIY Laser Cutter kit designed to be ready to use and includes software &amp; hardware.

## Latest Progress
I've been working at designing the cad on SketchUp, but I've reached the limits of what I can do with the software so I am redesigning everything with Fusion360.

I will also order the parts I need so I can get final measurements of all systems.

# Objectives & Roadmap
The goal of this design is to create a Laser Cutter kit that can be assembled at home/office/school with a limited amount of tools.

To achieve this goal, I will leverage at maximum stock parts and 3D printed parts.

#Features
This laser cutter is to include inside its case:

- a 45W Laser tube of high quality,

- a xy axis to carry the focusing lens,

- a cutting bed of min 500mm x 300mm, 

- a powersupply for the laser (high voltage),

- an airpump linked to the focusing lens mount,

- a water cooling system,

- a HEPA smoke filtration system,

- an efficient moving system (wheels, and all shock absorbing system to protect internal parts)

- a computing unit to control all aspect of the Laser
